    - Use of additional deinterlace methods of ffmpeg. This may require
      recompilation of ffmpeg (see hints in Makefile) (Thanks to Herbert Attenberger)
    - New OSD option for A/V sync selection. This is related to sync change
      from 2004-06-02. Normal sync is to get the sync pts from I-Frames only.
      To sync on any PTS you have to change this (DVB-T fix).
    - DFB: changed remote react on keypress instead of release
    - DFB: when selecting YUY2 mode you'll get an alpha blende OSD (at least

  2004-07-11 :
    - fix: compile problem when only one output method (DFB) is selected
    - DFB + vidix: selectable pixel format I420, YV12 via OSD
    - OSD: offer only those menu items which are useful for current output method

           and "4:3 normal" strings for selection instead of 0, 1 values
  2004-07-10 : softdevice-0.0.7pre1
    - use of ffmpegs deinterlacer, selectable via OSD. Thanks to Herbert Attenberger

    - fix compilation for LIBAVCODEC_BUILD <= 4686 (thanks to Luca Olivetti)
    - again fix savage colour key
    - revert OSD centering for FB + VIDIX out
      (it's a feature of vdr-1.3.7, OSD position is adjustable via OSD)

  2004-05-20 : softdevice-0.0.6pre3
    - fb output is now running with vdr-1.3.7 too
    - merged softdevice-0.0.5-fb-patch01
      (its intentionaly in the vdr-1.2.x section only)
    - fix OSD positioning fb-out + vidix-out for vdr-1.3.7

  2004-05-20 : softdevice-0.0.6pre2

        vdr-softdevice-0.0.5-xv08-2.patch

  2004-04-xx : patch08
    - checked vidix method too. I had to select I420 instead of YV12 ;;-).
      (With YV12 I got swaped color components. Vidix driver reports only
      16 of my 32M G550 ;-) ).

  2004-04-28 : patch07-02
    - fix: xv-color key for savage (workaround of X driver bug)
    - fix: compile problems with non CVS version of ffmpeg
    - new: xv: hack to control some atom values via keyboard.
               This bypasses VDR remote key control :-( .
               c/C  - contrast -/+
               h/H  - hue -/+
               b/B  - brightness -/+
               s/S  - saturation -/+
    - new: all output methods can be compiled in.
           method selectable at runtime via:
              '-vo xv:' or
              '-vo fb:' or
              '-vo dfb:' or
              '-vo vidix:'
           if there is only one method specified at compile time via Makefile
           this parameter is not required (tested only with xv and fb).

  2004-04-16 : xv output patch07
    - fix: force CheckAspect upon dimension change (since patch06)
    - report PAN/SCAN info if present

  2004-04-16 : xv output patch06
    - implemented StillPicture method
    - clean up some messages
    - AFD tag support

  2004-03-07 : xv output patch05
    - fixed rounding error for 16:9 output area (height 575 instead of 576).
    - OSD opaque black color translated to a different dark value so that it
      is different from the COLORKEY and no longer transparent.
    - xv output has now a commandline argument:
        -vo xv:aspect=[wide|normal]
        examples:
        ./vdr -P streamdev -P 'softdevice -vo xv:aspect=wide'
        ./vdr -P streamdev -P 'softdevice -vo xv:aspect=normal'
    - OSD not shown (for new users) during remote teaching phase
      (introduced by patch03).
    - changed last paramter of X..ShmPut..() to False and replaced XFlush()
      by XSync() (according to vlc this should save CPU time).
    - added volume control.

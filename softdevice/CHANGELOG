      on via epia boards. That could be used for others too if primary head

2005-07-15:
    - by Vadim Catana:
      - fixed a couple of compiler warnings for gcc4 on x86-64
      - the video-vidix.c and video-dfb.c both contain code
        that converts pictures from YV12 format to YUY2. I moved
        this common code to a function in utils.c .
      - Some channels display white dots at the top and bottom of
        the screen due to WSS data encoded in the picture.
        This problem has been mentioned on vdr, linux-dvb and
        dxr3 mailinglists a few times. I added two new items in
        the softdevice menu that allow to cut off a number of lines
        from top and bottom of the picture. It is implemented now
        only for -vo vidix and dfb with i420/YV12 format and hardware
        alpha blending.

  2004-10-23:
   - some fixes upon deinterlacing selection (bug: #002267)
   - added pseudo alpha OSD background upon an idea of Torgeir Veimo
  2004-10-18:
   - xv-out: allow disabling screensaver when in full screen mode (Torgeir Veimo)
   - mpeg2decoder: enable adjustable audio / video offset (Torgeir Veimo)
   - DFB: fix compare DFXL_NONE using equals (Torgeir Veimo)
  2004-08-09:

              toggle is done via pressing 'f'
              (works at the moment _only_ with gnome window manager)
  2004-08-01:
    - fix: syncOnFrames not stored (Torgeir Veimo)
    - fix: audio - some cards don't have any master volume (Torgeir Veimo)
  2004-07-25: softdevice-0.0.7pre2
    - Use of additional deinterlace methods of ffmpeg. This may require
      recompilation of ffmpeg (see hints in Makefile) (Thanks to Herbert Attenberger)
    - New OSD option for A/V sync selection. This is related to sync change
      from 2004-06-02. Normal sync is to get the sync pts from I-Frames only.
      To sync on any PTS you have to change this (DVB-T fix).
    - DFB: changed remote react on keypress instead of release
    - DFB: when selecting YUY2 mode you'll get an alpha blende OSD (at least
           with Matrox cards).
  2004-07-23:
    - xv-out: while mouse in window, auto hide cursor (thanks to Torgeir Veimo)
  2004-07-18:
    - moved ffmpeg version and build level report
    - setup-OSD does not depend on XV_SUPPORT
  2004-07-12:
    - fix: DFB cropping for 16:9 mode
    - OSD: softdevice menu now reachable via main menu entry
           menu behaves different to others: changes are active immediate,
           ok-key makes them permanent, back-key restores previous state.
  2004-07-11 :
    - fix: compile problem when only one output method (DFB) is selected
    - DFB + vidix: selectable pixel format I420, YV12 via OSD
    - OSD: offer only those menu items which are useful for current output method
    - OSD: changed text from "Xv-Aspect" to "Xv startup aspect" and use "16:9 wide"
           and "4:3 normal" strings for selection instead of 0, 1 values
  2004-07-10 : softdevice-0.0.7pre1
    - use of ffmpegs deinterlacer, selectable via OSD. Thanks to Herbert Attenberger
    - DFB out added aspect ratio and AFD handling
    - activate cropping support, selectable via OSD (xv-out + vidix-out + dfb-out)
  2004-07-09 : softdevice-0.0.6post3
    - DFB out set display layer configuration according to reported capabilities
    - DFB out use only first available video layer
  2004-06-28 :
    - DFB out changed COLORKEY to 0,0,0 to get transparent OSD with matrox
    - DFB out has it's own remote
    - DFB out only set videolayer if it is NOT set previously
  2004-06-02 : softdevice-0.0.6post2
             - added some addtional libs for ffmpeg which may be required
             - changed VIDIX out to probe for driver
             - fix for syncing on some DVB-T streams
  2004-05-30 - fix xv video refresh for MapNotify event
  2004-05-24 - added aspect ratio handling for VIDIX out
  2004-05-23 - added help text for commandline help

  2004-05-22 : softdevice-0.0.6
    - fix compilation for LIBAVCODEC_BUILD <= 4686 (thanks to Luca Olivetti)
    - again fix savage colour key
    - revert OSD centering for FB + VIDIX out
      (it's a feature of vdr-1.3.7, OSD position is adjustable via OSD)

  2004-05-20 : softdevice-0.0.6pre3
    - fb output is now running with vdr-1.3.7 too
    - merged softdevice-0.0.5-fb-patch01
      (its intentionaly in the vdr-1.2.x section only)
    - fix OSD positioning fb-out + vidix-out for vdr-1.3.7

  2004-05-20 : softdevice-0.0.6pre2
    - xv output now works with vdr-1.3.7 too

  2004-05-19 : softdevice-0.0.6pre1
    - audio.c: dropped round() call
    - (f)printf() replaced by dsyslog()
        audio.c video-xv.c video.c
    - merged Vadim's
        vdr-softdevice-0.0.5-xv08.patch and
        vdr-softdevice-0.0.5-xv08-2.patch

  2004-04-xx : patch08
    - checked vidix method too. I had to select I420 instead of YV12 ;;-).
      (With YV12 I got swaped color components. Vidix driver reports only
      16 of my 32M G550 ;-) ).

  2004-04-28 : patch07-02
    - fix: xv-color key for savage (workaround of X driver bug)
    - fix: compile problems with non CVS version of ffmpeg
    - new: xv: hack to control some atom values via keyboard.
               This bypasses VDR remote key control :-( .
               c/C  - contrast -/+
               h/H  - hue -/+
               b/B  - brightness -/+
               s/S  - saturation -/+
    - new: all output methods can be compiled in.
           method selectable at runtime via:
              '-vo xv:' or
              '-vo fb:' or
              '-vo dfb:' or
              '-vo vidix:'
           if there is only one method specified at compile time via Makefile
           this parameter is not required (tested only with xv and fb).

  2004-04-16 : xv output patch07
    - fix: force CheckAspect upon dimension change (since patch06)
    - report PAN/SCAN info if present

  2004-04-16 : xv output patch06
    - implemented StillPicture method
    - clean up some messages
    - AFD tag support

  2004-03-07 : xv output patch05
    - fixed rounding error for 16:9 output area (height 575 instead of 576).
    - OSD opaque black color translated to a different dark value so that it
      is different from the COLORKEY and no longer transparent.
    - xv output has now a commandline argument:
        -vo xv:aspect=[wide|normal]
        examples:
        ./vdr -P streamdev -P 'softdevice -vo xv:aspect=wide'
        ./vdr -P streamdev -P 'softdevice -vo xv:aspect=normal'
    - OSD not shown (for new users) during remote teaching phase
      (introduced by patch03).
    - changed last paramter of X..ShmPut..() to False and replaced XFlush()
      by XSync() (according to vlc this should save CPU time).
    - added volume control.

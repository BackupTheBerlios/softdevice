Changelog
2007-10-13:
   - shm-out: applied patch from Matthias Schwarzott to make ShmClient work
              at 1st start of softdevice with "-vo shm:".
              allow xv startup aspect selection for shm out too.
2007-09-27:
   - audio: added open for number of channels device names CH1, CH2, CH3, .. .
   - mpeg2decoder: workaround for some ac3 decoding issues.
2007-09-23:
   - configure: fix framebuffer check.
2007-09-16:
   - border detect: whole black area was cut out. that's not correct when aspect
     ratio is greater than 16/9. limit cut out area to 16/9.
   - russian translation by neptunvasja
2007-08-29:
   - compile fix for vdr-1.5.9 based on Stone's patch.
2007-07-12:
   - video / dfb: moved some code from video.c to video-dfb.c as announced
                  and changed some constants to those I use in productive VDR.
2007-07-11:
   - compile fix for: ./configure --disable-shm
   - applied patch from Matthias Schwarzott for compile issues with
     newer ffmpeg versions
   - applied patch from Artur Skawina for memory alignment error
   - video-xv: fix OSD parially not drawn or cleared in pseudo mode:
               - a small stripe remains on the right side, when video changed
                 from 16:9 to 4:3
               - only modified OSD was shown when deinterlacer was toggled
                 on/off.
2007-05-10:
   - use libswscale if available.
   - remove left over code from the old video-fb.
   - remove pixel mask option from SoftOsd.[hc] and video*, which was only used
     by the old video-fb.
   - adapt MacVdrClient.c to the setupStore in shared memory.
   - remove softlog from setupStore. Pointers aren't valid in a shared memory
     block.
   - remove private variable setupStore from audio out methods. They can
     access the global variable.
   - move setupStore into a shared memory block. This allows ShmClient to
     have acces to the setupStore.
   - move CatchRemoteKey() into utils.c, else setup-softdevice.o would
     have to be linked into libsoftdevice-xv.so and -dfb.so
2007-04-12:
   - ShmClient: revertet previous change, as it breaks argument style
                of softdevice.
   - configure: fix typo (yaepg),
                rm .dependencies in case of changes,
                new opt: --disable-xinerama (by Matthias Schwarzott)
   - fix osdMode not initialized (by Matthias Schwarzott)
   - ShmClient: full screen start option (by Matthias Schwarzott)
2007-04-11: softdevice-0.4.0
   - xv-out: activate suspend/resume key (r/R) via configure (by Artur Skawina).

   - almost complete rewrite of video-fb. Supported are now 15,16,24 and 32 bit
     depth framebuffers. The osd is rendered with software alpha blending,
     and it is even faster :-)
2007-03-12:
   - compile fix for recent ffmpeg SVN
   - include ffmpeg headers as 'extern "C"'
   - enable and use as default the software mixer. The old behaviour (use the

   - increase the stepsize of the software mixer.
   - don't scale audio if the volume is at maximum.
   - set edge_width/_height always to zero. Fixes picture shiftes with
     the ShmClient. This is not the optimal(/final) solution...

      plugins like softplay useing the new service interface
2005-11-06:
    - video-xv: some of X11 atoms could be set via OSD too. So using hardcoded
      hotkeys for brightness, contrast, hue and saturation is obsolete and
      may be removed soon.
    - video-dfb: (by Laurence Abbott) selecting field parity and triple buffering
      on via epia boards. That could be used for others too if primary head
      is connected to TV. Triple buffering is independently available as a
      separate option now.

2005-07-15:
    - by Vadim Catana:
      - fixed a couple of compiler warnings for gcc4 on x86-64
      - the video-vidix.c and video-dfb.c both contain code
        that converts pictures from YV12 format to YUY2. I moved
        this common code to a function in utils.c .
      - Some channels display white dots at the top and bottom of
        the screen due to WSS data encoded in the picture.
        This problem has been mentioned on vdr, linux-dvb and
        dxr3 mailinglists a few times. I added two new items in
        the softdevice menu that allow to cut off a number of lines
        from top and bottom of the picture. It is implemented now
        only for -vo vidix and dfb with i420/YV12 format and hardware
        alpha blending.

    - Use of additional deinterlace methods of ffmpeg. This may require
      recompilation of ffmpeg (see hints in Makefile) (Thanks to Herbert Attenberger)
    - New OSD option for A/V sync selection. This is related to sync change
      from 2004-06-02. Normal sync is to get the sync pts from I-Frames only.
      To sync on any PTS you have to change this (DVB-T fix).
    - DFB: changed remote react on keypress instead of release
    - DFB: when selecting YUY2 mode you'll get an alpha blende OSD (at least
           with Matrox cards).

           and "4:3 normal" strings for selection instead of 0, 1 values
  2004-07-10 : softdevice-0.0.7pre1
    - use of ffmpegs deinterlacer, selectable via OSD. Thanks to Herbert Attenberger
    - DFB out added aspect ratio and AFD handling
    - activate cropping support, selectable via OSD (xv-out + vidix-out + dfb-out)

    - DFB out changed COLORKEY to 0,0,0 to get transparent OSD with matrox
    - DFB out has it's own remote
    - DFB out only set videolayer if it is NOT set previously
  2004-06-02 : softdevice-0.0.6post2
             - added some addtional libs for ffmpeg which may be required
             - changed VIDIX out to probe for driver
             - fix for syncing on some DVB-T streams
  2004-05-30 - fix xv video refresh for MapNotify event

  2004-05-23 - added help text for commandline help

  2004-05-22 : softdevice-0.0.6
    - fix compilation for LIBAVCODEC_BUILD <= 4686 (thanks to Luca Olivetti)
    - again fix savage colour key
    - revert OSD centering for FB + VIDIX out
      (it's a feature of vdr-1.3.7, OSD position is adjustable via OSD)

  2004-05-20 : softdevice-0.0.6pre3
    - fb output is now running with vdr-1.3.7 too
    - merged softdevice-0.0.5-fb-patch01
      (its intentionaly in the vdr-1.2.x section only)
    - fix OSD positioning fb-out + vidix-out for vdr-1.3.7

  2004-05-20 : softdevice-0.0.6pre2
    - xv output now works with vdr-1.3.7 too

  2004-05-19 : softdevice-0.0.6pre1
    - audio.c: dropped round() call
    - (f)printf() replaced by dsyslog()
        audio.c video-xv.c video.c
    - merged Vadim's
        vdr-softdevice-0.0.5-xv08.patch and
        vdr-softdevice-0.0.5-xv08-2.patch

  2004-04-xx : patch08
    - checked vidix method too. I had to select I420 instead of YV12 ;;-).
      (With YV12 I got swaped color components. Vidix driver reports only
      16 of my 32M G550 ;-) ).

  2004-04-28 : patch07-02
    - fix: xv-color key for savage (workaround of X driver bug)
    - fix: compile problems with non CVS version of ffmpeg
    - new: xv: hack to control some atom values via keyboard.
               This bypasses VDR remote key control :-( .
               c/C  - contrast -/+
               h/H  - hue -/+
               b/B  - brightness -/+
               s/S  - saturation -/+
    - new: all output methods can be compiled in.
           method selectable at runtime via:
              '-vo xv:' or
              '-vo fb:' or
              '-vo dfb:' or
              '-vo vidix:'
           if there is only one method specified at compile time via Makefile
           this parameter is not required (tested only with xv and fb).

  2004-04-16 : xv output patch07
    - fix: force CheckAspect upon dimension change (since patch06)
    - report PAN/SCAN info if present

  2004-04-16 : xv output patch06
    - implemented StillPicture method
    - clean up some messages
    - AFD tag support

  2004-03-07 : xv output patch05
    - fixed rounding error for 16:9 output area (height 575 instead of 576).
    - OSD opaque black color translated to a different dark value so that it
      is different from the COLORKEY and no longer transparent.
    - xv output has now a commandline argument:
        -vo xv:aspect=[wide|normal]
        examples:
        ./vdr -P streamdev -P 'softdevice -vo xv:aspect=wide'
        ./vdr -P streamdev -P 'softdevice -vo xv:aspect=normal'
    - OSD not shown (for new users) during remote teaching phase
      (introduced by patch03).
    - changed last paramter of X..ShmPut..() to False and replaced XFlush()
      by XSync() (according to vlc this should save CPU time).
    - added volume control.

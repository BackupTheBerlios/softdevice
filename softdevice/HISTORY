VDR Plugin 'softdevice' Revision History
-----------------------------------

23-Nov-2003: Version 0.0.1	First version

28-Nov-2003: Version 0.0.2
    implemented A/V-Sync
    ALSA support for sound
    classes rewritten (for easier support of different output devices
    in later versions)

17-Dec-2003: Version 0.0.3
    there are now three different output-devices (enable these in the
    Makefile or softdevice.c). 

    Fbdev: I tried to implement scaling in the yuv->rgb routine. 
    But this messed up the code a little bit. In other words:
    It doesn't work!
    
    Vidix: Video output should work with Matrox.
    No OSD Implementation
    
    DirectFB: The methods how to access the video device are 
    only tested with the matrox card. Scaled video playback
    and OSD (without transparency) should work.
    
29-Dec-2003: Version 0.0.4
    More or less only a test release.
    
26-Jan-2004: Version 0.0.5
    Some changes in the code (OSD functions moved to video.c)
    FB-output scales now ( more or less perfect) to fullscreen
    DFB works 
    Vidix works
    maybe XV works (I didn't test it)

Description:

Plays media files with the VDR and the Softdevice as output device.

The softdevice uses ffmpeg to decode the mpeg2 video and audio streams. 
Since ffmpeg supports a lot more codecs than just mpeg2 it's quite easy
to make the softdevice decode all other codecs which are supported by ffmpeg.
This is what SoftPlay does. It reads the media file, puts the softdevice to
a special playback mode which supports other video/audio codecs than mpeg2 and
sends the video/audio packets directly to the softdevice.

Please note that this is a very early release, for me it works without any
troubles for .avi and for .mp3 files. Other file formats may or may not work.

Start with :
./vdr -Psoftdevice -P"softplay --media-path /path/to/media/files"
